VEHICLE DIMENSIONS

The maximum individual truck length is 12 metres

Articulated truck and trailer length is 16.5 metres and road trains are allowed up to 18.75 metres.

The maximum width for all is 2.55 metres. If a vehicle has an overall height of 3 metres
or above, a notice is required must be displayed in the cab showing its full height.


ABNORMAL LOADS

An ‘abnormal load’ is a vehicle that has any of the following:

A weight of more than 44,000 kilograms

An axle load of more than 10,000 kilograms for a single non-driving axle and 11,500 kilograms
 for a single driving axle

A width of more than 2.9 metres

A rigid length of more than 18.65 metres

If you’re responsible for transporting an abnormal load, you need to follow regulations for
notifying the authorities.



Depending on the load you’re moving and your route, you may need to give advance warning to:

The police

Highway authorities

Bridge and structure owners like Network Rail

!!!!!!!
TIP

A load that projects more than 2 metres to the front or rear of the vehicle must be fitted
with an end marker.

Side markers must be displayed if the front or rear projection exceeds 3 metres.

!!!!
Height restrictions
Areas that are vulnerable such as pipebridges, overhead gantries etc should be clearly
identified and height restrictions clearly marked.

The standard minimum clearance over every part of the carriageway of a public road
is 16 feet 6 inches (5.03 metres). When the clearance over any part is less than this,
standard warning signs both on and prior to the structure should be provided.
The stated clearance should be at least 75mm less than the measured height.

Heights of vehicle likely to be encountered are 4.2 metres high (i.e. A standard container
on a suitable flatbed vehicle). Minimum headroom provided should be 4.65 metres exclusive of
any additional space required for lighting units. Where emergency vehicle access is required,
 the height of such vehicles should be confirmed with the relevant emergency service.
 Additional clearance will be required if there is a requirement for an overlay in the future.
  Changes in gradient may also reduce the effective headroom for long vehicles.

!!!!!!!!!!
The current UK limits, set out in full in the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations
1986 (SI 1986/1078), as amended, are as follows:
weight
• 44 tonnes for lorries with 6 axles; drive axle(s) must not exceed 10500kg and have
road friendly suspension OR have a maximum axle weight not exceeding 8500kg.
Each part of the combination must have 3 axles and the trailer must have road
friendly suspension. Additionally, an engine complying with at least Euro 2
specification (or gas) is needed for operation over 41000kg.
• 40 tonnes for lorries with 5 axles with maximum axle weight limit of 11.5 tonnes
length
• 12 metres for a rigid vehicle
• 16.5 metres for an articulated vehicle if the articulated combination can turn within
a concentric radii of 12.5 metres and 5.3 metres; otherwise 15.5 metres
• 18.75 metres for a road train (a combination of a lorry and a trailer)
width
• 2.55 metres excluding driving mirrors
• refrigerated vehicles are permitted to be 2.6 metres wide to allow for the extra
thickness of the insulation
height • no limit, but wherever possible a maximum of 4.95 metres should be adhered to in
order to make maximum use of the motorway and trunk road network




1 yard = 3600/3937 meter or 1 yard = 0.914 401 8288 meter
this relation is equivalent to:

1 foot = 12/39.37 meter or 1 foot = 0.304 800 609 6012 meter
